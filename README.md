# Genetic_Algorithm
The goal is to solve travelling salesman problem with genetic algorithm:
- Generate 25 random cities in the three dimensional space where 0<x_city<3 , 0<y_city<4 , 0<z_city<5
- Encode these 25 points with alphabets from B to Z
- Encode the origin (0,0,0) as A
- Find the shortest way of starting from (0,0,0), crossing each city one and only one time, coming back to (0,0,0)
